# ark_automate_local

Locally execute robots build with ark_automate

## MacOS
Because of missing security permissions we are currently not able to provide this version of the local client for MacOS. We recommend running it in a virtual machine instead.

## Setup

- make sure you have node and robot framework installed on your machine
- make sure you have rpaframework installed (version 9.6.0 | use `pip install --upgrade rpaframework` to upgrade)
- execute npm install -g

## Get started

Start the application in the current directory by running **ark** in your command line
